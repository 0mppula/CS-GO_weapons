# CS:GO Weapons

---

#### Introduction

This simple web application allows the user to cycle through a list of weapons from the game **`Counter-Strike Global Offensive`**. These particular weapons are objects, which are instantiated when the whole page is loaded with the `window.load` event listener. Users can shoot one or multiple shots with each weapon, additionally each weapon can be reloaded.

#### Technologies

This web application is coded with vanilla JavaScript, coupled with HTML5 and CSS. The weapons are simply `.png` images, and the audio files are short `.wav` files. My intentions were to implement the functionality of the weapons in JavaScript `classes`, I believe, that I achieved that task relatively well, considering my not so <em>senior</em> skills.

### Bugs

There are a few bugs in this project, and **any** help or contributions are **HUGELY** appreciated!! ðŸ™‚

**Bug #1:** I can't seem to decrease the loading times of the weapons or the loading times for the weapons audio effects sufficiently to work smoothly on deployed [live versions](www.google.com). (<em>latency of switching or shooting weapons for the first</em>).<br> This web application works perfectly, and the way it was initially intented to work on local machines.
